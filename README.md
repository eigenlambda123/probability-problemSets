# Probability Problem Sets â€“ Based on *Introduction to Probability* by Blitzstein

This repository contains my organized solutions and study notes for the textbook *Introduction to Probability* by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang. It serves as a personal study log and problem set archive as I work through key concepts and exercises to deepen my intuition and technical fluency in probability.

## Structure & Organization

Each folder corresponds to a major topic or chapter in the book. Within each folder you'll find:

* **Problem Sets** with my handwritten or typed solutions
* **Brief Notes** summarizing key concepts when needed
* **Diagrams** or visualizations (if applicable)
* **Subdirectories** for specific sections (e.g., `Basic Counting`, `Conditional Probability`, `Random Variables`)

## How I'm Solving

Most problems are:

* Solved **by hand** in a notebook
* Then typed using Markdown for clarity and future reference
* Accompanied by concise notes explaining the **reasoning behind each solution**

The focus is not speed but **mastery**â€”this effort is part of my long-term technical foundation building under my [Project10X Stats](#) study plan.

## Work In Progress

This repository is growing gradually as I progress through the book. Some sections may still be drafts or contain only partial work.

## Covered Topics (in progress)

* [x] Basic Counting (sets, permutations, combinations)
* [ ] Conditional Probability
* [ ] Bayesâ€™ Rule & Independence
* [ ] Random Variables
* [ ] Expectation, Variance
* [ ] Discrete and Continuous Distributions
* [ ] Joint Distributions
* [ ] Law of Large Numbers
* [ ] Central Limit Theorem

---

## Tools Used

* Markdown + Git for version control and formatting
* LaTeX (via KaTeX or MathJax) for clean math notation
* Diagrams created by hand or with drawing tools (Desmos, draw\.io, etc.)
